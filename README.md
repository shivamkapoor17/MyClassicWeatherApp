# MyClassicWeatherWebApp

This Classic weather Web App is build with Python-Flask. 
This Web App fatches the weather information from openweathermap.org using an API Key.
This is very easy to use website Both the frontend and backend is developed by me.
It has login, signup, password reset email functionality too and much more so give it a look

You can see weather information of any city you want only you need to configure few things 
1. You have to put your api key in place of 'Your_Api_Key' in the weather.py file. You can get your api key from openweathermap.org when you signed up.
2. In weather.py file you also have to set your flask_sqlalchemy database uri
3. I also hide some of the sensitive information in system environment variables so in place of that you put your information in order to get website works.
